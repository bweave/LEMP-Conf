LEMP-Conf
=========

Config files and settings for a wicked fast Ubuntu + Nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL/Percona setup.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu box
- Nginx
- PHP-FPM
- MySQL/Percona (Percona is SO much faster, just do it!)

## Usage

Using these files as reference, copy over the settings to the corresponding files on your Ubuntu box.

**Note**: I've added comments throughout, but ***PLEASE*** do your own research and use the setting that are best for your needs.

### Props

This set of config files is very heavily influenced by [@StevenCorona's](http://twitter.com/stevencorona) book [Scaling PHP](https://www.scalingphpbook.com/). It's a fantastic read, so go get yourself a copy!
